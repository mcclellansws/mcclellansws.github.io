    <h3>Requirements:</h3>

    <p>2 or more players. Best if played in teams.</p>

    <p>One more full decks of cards than the number of players.</p>

    <h3>The Play:</h3>

    <p>Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle and shuffle again. Place
    the cards in several piles in the center of the play area as
    the draw piles and five cards turned upright in the center as
    the discard pile.</p>

    <p>Then each player attempts to cut 22 cards off the top of the
    draw piles. If successful, that player/team gets 100 points.
    Each player counts out the cut cards into two piles of 11
    cards. They then exchanges piles with the players on each side of them.
    Without looking at the two piles you receive, choose one as
    your "hand" and put the other (your "foot") aside. The contents
    of the "foot" remain a mystery until you are able to play all the
    cards from your "hand".</p>

    <p>Each player's turn begins by drawing (see below for how many) and ends
    when by discaring one card into the discard pile. During the
    turn, the player scores by starting or adding to a meld. A meld
    is three or more of a kind. You can not form melds from 3s
    (since black 3s are  worth zero and red 3s put you
    <span class=" underline">back</span> 300 points). 3s must be discarded.
    Wise players discard their red 3s first.</p>

    <p>A meld may only contain half as many wilds as natural cards.
    You may never have more than two wild cards in a meld. For
    example:</p>

    <table summary="Example wild card ratio">
      <tr>
        <td>AA2 is OK</td>

        <td>AA22 is illegal</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>AAAA22 is OK</td>

        <td>AAAA222 is illegal</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>To begin forming melds, one player from each team must be
    able to "go down" with at least the minimum points for that
    round. The minimum points for the first round is 50 and goes up
    by 20 points each round after that. After someone from that
    a team has "gone down", the rest of that team is free to add 
    to their team's existing melds or create new ones without 
    having to meet the minimum point requirement.</p>

    <p>When a meld has seven cards, it must be closed to form a
    "book." A book with no wild cards is called a "Clean Book"
    and is worth 500 points. A book with one or more wild cards is
    called a "Dirty Book" ad is worth 300 points. When a book is
    closed the cards in the line are piled into a neat stack with a
    red card on top if the books is clean or a black card on top if
    the book is dirty (contains any wild cards). Once a meld has 
    become a book, no more wild cards may be added to it. However,
    additional matching natural cards can be added. Also,
    once a meld has become a book the player/team may start a new
    meld of the same denomination if they have three or more of
    that kind. The advantage of starting a new meld is the possability
    that the team could complete yet another book or possible draw
    from the middle (more on this later).</p>

    <p>When a player starts their turn, they have two choices for
    their draw. They may draw any two cards off of the top of any 
    of, the draw pile(s), or they may draw the top five cards off 
    of the discard pile if they can
    use the <span class=" underline">top card</span> of the discard
    pile with a natural pair <span class=" underline">already in their
    hand</span> to form a NEW meld. Only after the new meld is formed
    with the natural pair from their hand with the top card of the
    discard pile, may the player play or add to their hand the remaining 
    four cards from the discard pile.
    
    <p> When the player has played all the cards they can wor wish, they
    discard one card to end their turn. At which time the player to the
    left begins their turn by drawing.</p>

    <p>When a player is able to use all of the cards in their
    "hand", they may then pick up and use the cards in their "foot".
    If the last card of their "hand" is played by discarding, it is
    said that they are "looking" and can pick up their "foot" and begin
    sorting. But their turn is over until their next turn.</p>
    
    <p>If the last card is played into an open meld or
    book, then the player is "still playing" and may continue to play
    from the cards in their "foot". </p>

    <p>The round ends when a player is able to play (not discard),
    into an open meld or book, the last card from their "foot".
    This is know as "going out". However, a player is not allowed to 
    "go out" until all of
    their partners are at least in their feet, and the team has at least
    <span class=" underline">two clean and two dirty
    books.</span></p>

    <p>Scoring takes place after each round. The team that went out
    receives 100 points. Each team adds all of their books (clean
    and dirty), the contents of all of their melds and books, and
    subtracts the points in their hands and feet. Remember that each
    red 3 left in a teams "hand" or "foot" subtract 300 point from
    that team's score for that round.</p>

    <p>The number of rounds in a game is equal to the number of players.
    Each player should have a the oportunity bo the the first to draw
    in a round. The team with the most points at the end is the
    winner.</p>
