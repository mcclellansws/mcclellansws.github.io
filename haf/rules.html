    <h3>Requirements:</h3>

    <p>2 or more players. Best if played in teams.</p>

    <p>One more full decks of cards than the number of players.</p>

    <h3>The Play:</h3>

    <p>Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle and shuffle again. Place
      the cards in several piles in the center of the play area as
      the draw piles and five cards turned upright in the center as
      the discard pile.</p>

    <p>Then each player attempts to cut 22 cards off the top of the
      draw piles. If successful, that player/team gets 100 points.
      Each player counts out the cut cards into two piles of 11
      cards. They then exchanges piles with the players on each side of them.
      Without looking at the two piles you receive, choose one as
      your "hand" and put the other (your "foot") aside. The contents
      of the "foot" remain a mystery until you are able to play all the
      cards from your "hand".</p>

    <p>Each player's turn begins by drawing (see below for how many) and ends
      when by discaring one card into the discard pile. During the
      turn, the player scores by starting or adding to a meld. A meld
      is three or more of a kind. You can not form melds from 3s
      (since black 3s are worth zero and red 3s put you
      <span class="underline">back</span> 300 points). 3s must be discarded.
      Wise players discard their red 3s first.
    </p>

    <p>A meld may only contain half as many wilds as natural cards.
      You may never have more than two wild cards in a meld. For
      example:</p>

    <table summary="Example wild card ratio">
      <tr>
        <td>AA2 is OK</td>

        <td>AA22 is illegal</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>AAAA22 is OK</td>

        <td>AAAA222 is illegal</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>To begin forming melds, one player from each team must be
      able to "go down" with at least the minimum points for that
      round. The minimum points for the first round is 50 and goes up
      by 20 points each round after that. After someone from that
      a team has "gone down", the rest of that team is free to add
      to their team's existing melds or create new ones without
      having to meet the minimum point requirement.</p>

    <p>When a meld has seven cards, it must be closed to form a
      "book." A book with no wild cards is called a "Clean Book"
      and is worth 500 points. A book with one or more wild cards is
      called a "Dirty Book" ad is worth 300 points. When a book is
      closed the cards in the line are piled into a neat stack with a
      red card on top if the books is clean or a black card on top if
      the book is dirty (contains any wild cards). Once a meld has
      become a book, no more wild cards may be added to it. However,
      additional matching natural cards can be added. Also,
      once a meld has become a book the player/team may start a new
      meld of the same denomination if they have three or more of
      that kind. The advantage of starting a new meld is the possability
      that the team could complete yet another book or possible draw
      from the middle (more on this later).</p>

    <p>When a player starts their turn, they have two choices for
      their draw. They may draw any two cards off of the top of any
      of, the draw pile(s), or they may draw the top five cards off
      of the discard pile if they can
      use the <span class="underline">top card</span> of the discard
      pile with a natural pair <span class="underline">already in their
        hand</span> to form a NEW meld. Only after the new meld is formed
      with the natural pair from their hand with the top card of the
      discard pile, may the player play or add to their hand the remaining
      four cards from the discard pile.

    <p> When the player has played all the cards they can wor wish, they
      discard one card to end their turn. At which time the player to the
      left begins their turn by drawing.</p>

    <p>When a player is able to use all of the cards in their
      "hand", they may then pick up and use the cards in their "foot".
      If the last card of their "hand" is played by discarding, it is
      said that they are "looking" and can pick up their "foot" and begin
      sorting. But their turn is over until their next turn.</p>

    <p>If the last card is played into an open meld or
      book, then the player is "still playing" and may continue to play
      from the cards in their "foot". </p>

    <p>The round ends when a player is able to play (not discard),
      into an open meld or book, the last card from their "foot".
      This is know as "going out". However, a player is not allowed to
      "go out" until all of
      their partners are at least in their feet, and the team has at least
      <span class="underline">two clean and two dirty
        books.</span>
    </p>

    <p>Scoring takes place after each round. The team that went out
      receives 100 points. Each team adds all of their books (clean
      and dirty), the contents of all of their melds and books, and
      subtracts the points in their hands and feet. Remember that each
      red 3 left in a teams "hand" or "foot" subtract 300 point from
      that team's score for that round.</p>

    <p>The number of rounds in a game is equal to the number of players.
      Each player should have a the oportunity bo the the first to draw
      in a round. The team with the most points at the end is the
      winner.</p>
